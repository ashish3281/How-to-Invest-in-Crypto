      <header>What is cryptocurrency?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that does not rely on banks to verify transactions. Cryptocurrency
          payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database. When cryptocurrency funds are transferred, the
          transactions are recorded in a public ledger.
        <ul>
          <li>In cryptocurrency, “coins” (which are publicly agreed on records of ownership) are generated or produced
            by “miners”.</li>
          <li>These miners are people who run programs on ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) devices made
            specifically to solve proof-of-work puzzles.</li>
          <li>The work behind mining coins gives them value, while the scarcity of coins and demand for them causes
            their value to fluctuate.</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrencies can be used for buying goods just like fiat currency.</li>
          <li>Cryptocurrencies use encryption to verify and protect transactions.</li>
          <li>It does not exist in physical form and is not typically issued by any central authority.</li>
          <li>They use decentralized control in contrast to central bank digital currency.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>

        <h2> Some of the best-known cryptocurrencies are:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Bitcoin: Bitcoin is the most widely accepted cryptocurrency. Founded in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is
            still the most commonly traded. It is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on a
            peer-to-peer bitcoin network. </li>
          <li>Ether: Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network. Each Ethereum account has an
            ETH balance and may send ETH to any other account. The smallest subunit of Ether is known as Wei. </li>
          <li>Litecoin: Litecoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and in technical terms, Litecoin is nearly identical
            to Bitcoin. It uses scrypt in its proof-of-work algorithm. It is an adaptation of Bitcoin that is intended
            to make payment easier. </li>
          <li>Stablecoins: These are the class of cryptocurrencies whose values are designed to stay stable relative to
            real-world assets like the U.S. Dollar.</li>
          <li>Solana: Solana is a competitor of Ethereum whose main emphasis is on speed and cost-effectiveness.</li>

      <header>Advantages of cryptocurrency</header>
      <article>
        <p>With the industrialization and involvement of technology, digital currencies are gaining an upper hand over
          others. One such currency is bitcoins. Many of us are familiar with this well-known terminology. The only
          confusing thing is Cryptocurrency. What are its pros and cons? Is it worth investing in 2023? If you have such
          questions, get them answered here. Below you will find the major advantages of Cryptocurrencies.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Protection from inflation –</b>
            Inflation has caused many currencies to get their value declined with time. Almost every cryptocurrency, at
            the time of its launch, is released with a fixed amount. The source code specifies the amount of any coin;
            like, there are only 21 million Bitcoins released in the world. So, as the demand increases, its value will
            increase which will keep up with the market and, in the long run, prevent inflation.</li>

          <li><b>Self-governed and managed –</b>
            Governance and maintenance of any currency is a major factor for its development. The cryptocurrency
            transactions are stored by developers/miners on their hardware, and they get the transaction fee as a reward
            for doing so. Since the miners are getting paid for it, they keep transaction records accurate and
            up-to-date, keeping the integrity of the cryptocurrency and the records decentralized.
          </li>
          <li><b>Secure and private –</b>
            Privacy and security have always been a major concern for cryptocurrencies. The blockchain ledger is based
            on different mathematical puzzles, which are hard to decode. This makes a cryptocurrency more secure than
            ordinary electronic transactions. Cryptocurrencies, for better security and privacy, use pseudonyms that are
            unconnected to any user, account or stored data that could be linked to a profile.
          </li>
          <li><b>Currency exchanges can be done easily –</b>
            Cryptocurrency can be bought using many currencies like the US dollar, European euro, British pound, Indian
            rupee or Japanese yen. With the help of different cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, one currency can be
            converted into the other by trading in cryptocurrency, across different wallets, and with minimal
            transaction fees.
          </li>
          <li><b>Decentralized –</b>
            A major pro of cryptocurrency is that they are mainly decentralized. A lot of cryptocurrencies are
            controlled by the developers using it and the people who have a significant amount of the coin, or by an
            organization to develop it before it is released into the market. The decentralization helps keep the
            currency monopoly free and in check so that no one organization can determine the flow and the value of the
            coin, which, in turn, will keep it stable and secure, unlike fiat currencies which are controlled by the
            government.
          </li>
          <li><b>Cost-effective mode of transaction –</b>
            One of the major uses of cryptocurrencies is to send money across borders. With the help of cryptocurrency,
            the transaction fees paid by a user is reduced to a negligible or zero amount. It does so by eliminating the
            need for third parties, like VISA or PayPal, to verify a transaction. This removes the need to pay any extra
            transaction fees.
          </li>
          <li><b>A fast way to transfer funds –</b>
            Cryptocurrencies have always kept itself as an optimal solution for transactions. Transactions, whether
            international or domestic in cryptocurrencies, are lightning-fast. This is because the verification requires
            very little time to process as there are very few barriers to cross.

      <header>Disadvantages of cryptocurrency</header>
      <article>
        <p>Below you will find the major disadvantages of Cryptocurrencies:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Can be used for illegal transactions –</b>
            Since the privacy and security of cryptocurrency transactions are high, it’s hard for the government to
            track down any user by their wallet address or keep tabs on their data. Bitcoin has been used as a mode of
            exchanging money in a lot of illegal deals in the past, such as buying drugs on the dark web.
            Cryptocurrencies are also used by some to convert their illicitly obtained money through a clean
            intermediary, to hide its source.
          </li>
          <li><b>Data losses can cause financial losses –</b>
            The developers wanted to create virtually untraceable source code, strong hacking defenses, and impenetrable
            authentication protocols.
            This would make it safer to put money in cryptocurrencies than physical cash or bank vaults. But if any user
            loses the private key to their wallet, there’s no getting it back. The wallet will remain locked away along
            with the number of coins inside it. This will result in the financial loss of the user.
          </li>
          <li><b>Decentralized but still operated by some organization –</b>
            The cryptocurrencies are known for its feature of being decentralized. But, the flow and amount of some
            currencies in the market are still controlled by their creators and some organizations. These holders can
            manipulate the coin for large swings in its price. Even hugely traded coins are susceptible to these
            manipulations like Bitcoin, whose value doubled several times in 2017.
          </li>
          <li><b>Some coins not available in other fiat currencies –</b>
            Some cryptocurrencies can only be traded in one or a few fiat currencies. This forces the user to convert
            these currencies into one of the major currencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum first and then through other
            exchanges, to their desired currency. This applies to only a few cryptocurrencies. By doing this, the extra
            transaction fees are added in the process, costing unnecessary money.
          </li>
          <li><b>Adverse Effects of mining on the environment –</b>
            Mining cryptocurrencies require a lot of computational power and electricity input, making it highly
            energy-intensive. The biggest culprit in this is Bitcoin. Mining Bitcoin requires advanced computers and a
            lot of energy. It cannot be done on ordinary computers. Major Bitcoin miners are in countries like China
            that use coal to produce electricity. This has increased China’s carbon footprint tremendously.
          </li>
          <li><b>Susceptible to hacks –</b>
            Although cryptocurrencies are very secure, exchanges are not that secure. Most exchanges store the wallet
            data of users to operate their user ID properly. This data can be stolen by hackers, giving them access to a
            lot of accounts.
            After getting access, these hackers can easily transfer funds from those accounts. Some exchanges, like
            Bitfinex or Mt Gox, have been hacked in the past years and Bitcoin has been stolen in thousands and millions
            of US dollars. Most exchanges are highly secure nowadays, but there is always a potential for another hack.
          </li>
          <li><b>No refund or cancellation policy –</b>
            If there is a dispute between concerning parties, or if someone mistakenly sends funds to a wrong wallet
            address, the coin cannot be retrieved by the sender. This can be used by many people to cheat others out of
            their money. Since there are no refunds, one can easily be created for a transaction whose product or
            services they never received.
          </li>

      <header>Cryptocurrency trading vs. Investing</header>
      <article>
        <p>As you learn how to buy and trade cryptocurrencies, you must differentiate between crypto trading and
          investing. What is the difference? Which is better? And, how do you take advantage of this distinction to
          effectively make your trades? The two terms are often used interchangeably, but they are different.

          They are only similar to the extent that the end goal is the same – gaining profit from your activities. They
          are different in that results from trading activities are generally expected within a short to medium-term
          period. This could be anything from minutes or hours to a few days or weeks. With investing, the trader is in
          it for the long haul. We’re talking about months all the way to years or even more.

          As a beginner, you probably want to choose a trading strategy that involves medium to long-term trading and
          investing. This will typically require more time to research and analyze your trades before committing.</p>

      <header>Crypto market vs. Stock market</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The stock market has been around for a long time now, and there is a bunch of literature on the topic. But,
          how different or similar is it from or to the nascent cryptocurrency market? Here’s how.
        </p>
        <h2>Similarities between the crypto and stock market</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Stock trading and investing tools are more or less the same.</b> This is especially true for technical
            traders using tools such as charts to analyze the market. You can use the same tools to perform TA
            (Technical Analysis) for trades on either market.</li>
          <li><b>Assets denominated using fiat currencies.</b> The crypto market may be innovative and revolutionary
            with the assets designed to append the current financial system. However, the denominations in the
            marketplace are still valued compared to fiat currencies similar to the stock market.</li>
          <li><b>Trading and investing strategies are similar.</b>In the stock market, traders can choose to day trade,
            swing, or position trade. They can also opt to buy and hold their assets for the long term. Similarly,
            traders and investors in the crypto market can do the same things.</li>
          <li><b>Similar market products.</b> The stock market has been around for generations, leading to innovative
            products such as derivatives and techniques such as using leverage to inflate gains (and losses.) Those same
            products and techniques have been ported over to the new age cryptocurrency market. You can now trade
            Bitcoin futures, options, and leveraged tokens. You can use leverage on most of your trades on most leading
            cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance, Bitfinex, or BitMEX. The full list of digital asset exchanges
            with a leverage trading here.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Differences between the stock markets and crypto markets</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Market volatility.</b> Owing to its old age, the stock market is more stable and less volatile. The
            crypto market, on the other hand, is accustomed to wild price swings. It is pretty normal to see
            double-digit percentage swings in a matter of hours.</li>
          <li><b>Market maturity.</b> Age is a significant factor in trading. The stock market has been around for a
            long time, while the crypto market is only about a decade old. This means that market value and trade volume
            in the former is much larger compared to the latter. The younger age also contributes to the wild volatility
            experienced in the crypto market.</li>
          <li><b>Market assets.</b> In the stock market, you invest in the publicly listed company shares by buying
            their stocks. In the crypto market, you invest in the idea, the technology, or the currency (or token), but
            not the company (if any) behind the currency.</li>
          <li><b>Regulations.</b> Since the stock market has been around for ages, regulators have had enough time to
            develop and implement rules and regulations governing the market’s conduct. This contributes to the minimal
            volatility we highlighted earlier. In the cryptocurrency market, this is not the case. The regulators are
            still grappling with understanding the emerging asset class, and this lack of (proper) regulations are part
            of the reason for the market’s wild nature. However, this is changing, according to the Internal Revenue
            Service (IRS), as of 2022, traders must pay crypto tax.</li>

      <header>Why trade cryptocurrencies?</header>
      <article>
        <p>Given that cryptocurrencies seem to have more negatives against the stock market but not enough positives,
          why would you want to trade digital assets? Well, here are some of the pros below.</p>
        <h2>Benefits of cryptocurrency trading</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>24-hour trading.</b> As opposed to the stock market that opens and closes at specified times, there is
            no closing of the cryptocurrency market. You can trade cryptocurrencies 24/7/365 or even use trading bots
            and let your trades run all the time.</li>
          <li><b>Market volatility.</b> This may be seen as both a negative and a positive feature. In the previous
            section, we focused on the negative, but let’s talk about the positive. Traders (not investors) live off
            market volatility. The crypto market has this in troves, and this means that as a trader, you will get
            better trading opportunities with the cryptocurrency market as opposed to the stock market.</li>
          <li><b>Privacy and anonymity.</b> If you’re big on your right to privacy, then you will love cryptocurrency
            trading. With crypto trading, you have access to decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges. These allow you to
            trade with self-custody assets (when only you have possession of your digital money) without the need to
            submit your identity online. Of course, there are centralized trading platforms if you don’t mind sharing
            your particulars and having another party storing your digital assets.</li>
          <li><b>The multitude of assets.</b> Despite its relatively young age, the crypto market has advanced so much
            so fast that traders now have access to similar stock market products, including futures, options, leveraged
            tokens, swaps, CFDs (contracts for difference). Whether you want to go long or short, ‘call’ it or ‘put’ it,
            look no further. Every kind of derivative currently available on the stock market has already been ported
            over. If not, it’s coming soon.</li>
          <li><b>Easy account opening.</b> In crypto, there is a shallow barrier to entry. You can easily create an
            account in an exchange and start trading in a matter of minutes. That’s how fast it is to jump on board.
        </ul>

      <header>Cryptocurrency trading techniques</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          There are two main techniques to use to analyze and evaluate cryptocurrency. The techniques have existed for
          generations and have successfully been implemented for traditional financial assets. These are the Fundamental
          Analysis (FA) and Technical Analysis (TA). Often they are used complementary to each other, but it is possible
          to apply either independently.
        </p>
        <h2>Fundamental Analysis (or FA)</h2>
        <p>
          FA is the art of a trader using both economic and financial factors affecting a given asset to determine an
          asset’s value. Through FA, you will be able to know whether that asset is either overvalued or undervalued at
          the current valuation. If you can figure out that question, you can then decide whether or not to invest,
          when, and for how long a period you would look to keep the investment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fundamental analysis for cryptocurrency involves evaluating two important factors – on-chain and off-chain
          metrics. On-chain metrics include network hash rate, wallet addresses (active and dormant), network
          applications, token/coin issuance rate (inflation/deflation), network fees, and transactions.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily, with cryptocurrency, most of the networks are public such as Bitcoin and Ethereum making access to
          these on-chain factors easy. To track both Bitcoin and Ethereum on-chain metrics, you can use
          Bitinfocharts.com. This website has loads of crypto-related data and is extremely simple to use and navigate.
        </p>
        <p>Off-chain metrics basically include community engagement, exchange listings, government regulations, etc.</p>
        <h2>Technical Analysis (or TA)</h2>
        <p>Technical analysis is a trading discipline predicated upon the idea that a trader could predict an asset’s
          future price movements, given its historical price action. TA uses a host of technical indicators to achieve
          this, including trade volume, moving averages, trend lines, candlesticks, chart patterns, and more. At the end
          of a technical analysis, a trader should have identified trading opportunities and a potential entry point.
        </p>
        <p>Cryptocurrency technical analysis can work for any trading timeline, from scalping and day trading to
          long-term investments.</p>
       
        
        </iframe>
        <h2>FA vs. TA – which is better?</h2>
        <p>It entirely depends on the trader profile. Do you want to be the kind of trader that prefers to get in and
          out of trading positions multiple times a day (i.e., day trader)? Then crypto technical analysis will be your
          best friend. Instead, do you prefer to research and make informed bets every time (i.e., swing trader)? Then –
          a mix of both is the way to go.</p>
        <p>For instance, you may use FA to determine that an asset is worth investing in. What you may not uncover with
          FA, however, is the right time to invest. For this, you will have to rely on technical analysis. Conversely,
          if you are using TA to work out future price movements for a given asset, you can use FA to confirm whether or
          not the price trend you are witnessing is poised to continue.</p>
        <p>Therefore, there are advantages to using either technique over the other at various moments in your research,
          but to have a more complete picture, use both.</p>

        When it comes to the available cryptocurrency markets, just like the traditional financial instrument markets,
        there are two classes: the spot and the derivatives markets.

        <h2>Crypto spot market</h2>
        <p>As the name suggests, in a crypto spot market, assets are either bought or sold on the spot, meaning that
          delivery happens “on the spot.” If you buy Bitcoins, the coins are delivered immediately, and the payment is
          also settled immediately.
        </p>
        <p>The spot market is made up of two kinds of traders:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Makers –</b> these are the initiators of a trade. As a maker, you list a potential trade on an
            exchange. For instance, if you want to sell your Ethereum coins, you will open a trade at a particular price
            point, inviting a potential buyer to fulfill your order.</li>
          <li><b>Takers –</b> on the other side of the equation will be the trader that fulfills the order, and these
            are referred to as takers. As the name suggests, these traders “take” already existing orders and fulfills
            them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Makers bring liquidity to the marketplace. There are makers and takers on either side of the purchase coin.
          There are makers for both buy and sell orders, and consequently, there are takers for both buy and sell
          orders. An order book is the ledger on which available orders yet to be fulfilled are recorded.
        </p>
        <p>For instance, if you are a buying taker, you could scan through the order book and opt to fulfill (take) an
          order that already exists or place an order. The platform will automatically match your purchase order with an
          already existing sell order.
        </p>
        <h2>Crypto derivatives market</h2>
        <p>The cryptocurrency derivatives marketplace consists of financial instruments whose value is based on a
          virtual currency’s value. These derivatives can be based on other derivatives’ value and forming multiple
          tiers – a house of cards if you will.
        </p>
        <p>The derivatives are typically contracts of two or more parties with these contracts deriving their value from
          underlying assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Just like their counterparts in the
          traditional stock markets, there are multiple derivative products in the crypto sphere. Common crypto
          derivatives examples are futures contracts, options contracts, contracts for difference (CFDs), leveraged
          tokens, and token swaps. Important: Derivative instruments should only be used by experienced crypto traders.

      <header>Cryptocurrency trading strategy</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          To be successful in cryptocurrency trading, you will need an effective trading strategy. What is it? A trading
          strategy is simply a plan that you will follow when executing your trades. It will comprise the kind of assets
          to invest in, the frequency of your trades, and your investments’ size.

          In this section, we will discuss some of the most common crypto trading strategies. Although keep in mind that
          you can always create your personal strategy that works for you. It could be based on these broad strategies
          or something completely new.
        </p>

        <h2>Why you need a trading plan</h2>
        <p>Here’s why a crypto trading strategy is crucial to your success:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>It’s a map.</b> Having and maintaining a trading strategy is akin to having a map. It guides your
            trades, helping you know when to trade, how, and why to perform a certain trade.</li>
          <li><b>Keeps emotions at bay.</b> One of the biggest challenges facing traders is the interference of feelings
            and emotions. These become an impediment when an asset’s price starts trending in the opposite direction to
            a bet. In cryptocurrency, this happens so frequently that it easily leads to an emotional roller coaster.
            Successful traders have learned to keep trades free of emotions by sticking to their trading plans.</li>
          <li><b>Risk management.</b> Having a trading plan effectively forces you to do the research necessary to
            create one, and part of that research is the risk factor to consider for every trade. Risk identification is
            the first step toward risk management.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Crypto day trading and Scalping</h2>
        <p>A crypto day trading strategy allows the trader to take full advantage of cryptocurrency assets’ price
          volatility. As mentioned earlier, virtual assets are currently extremely volatile, which works to the
          advantage of a day trader.
        </p>
        <p>The crypto day trading strategy is a game of numbers strategy. A day trader will make multiple trades within
          a day, buying low and selling high within little gains that compound to large sums by the end of the day.
          Typically, sometimes it gets hard to perform this manually. For day trading crypto and to succeed in this
          strategy, you will need to consider automating your trades using crypto trading apps or crypto trading bots
          like Coinrule.
        </p>
        <p>Scalping (a trading strategy in which traders profit off small price changes) is a part of day trading but
          typically involves concise trading periods. Think minutes.

          When either day trading or scalping, many trades will result in both wins and losses. The idea is to make sure
          that the win/loss ratio is in your favor. Score more wins to consider your strategy a success.</p>
        <h2>Swing trading</h2>
        <p>When it comes to swing trading, the time period varies. Whilst in day trading and scalping, traders typically
          open and close positions multiple times within a day. In swing trading, this happens within a much longer
          period. This could be anything from a few days to a few months.
          <br />
          A crypto swing trader will aim to take advantage of an incoming or ongoing trend. In crypto, this strategy is
          sometimes referred to as BTFD (“buying the f’n dip”). It means buying when the price is low and selling when
          the price is high. Extensive application of both FA and TA techniques is necessary when using this strategy.
        </p>
        <h2>Position trading (HODL)</h2>
        <p>Also called trend trading or following the trend, this strategy involves long-term investing in assets. A
          trader/investor will typically buy or invest in an asset when the price is low and sell when the price is
          high, not unlike the other strategies. The only difference is the long time periods between opening and
          closing a position.
          <br />
          Trades set up through this strategy could take months and sometimes years. It is an ideal strategy for
          investors favoring a more hands-off approach. This strategy is sometimes called ‘HODL’ (or Hold On for Dear
          Fife) in cryptocurrency. The term is derived from a play on the word ‘hold’ – to buy and hold. A crypto trader
          would invest in a coin or token and hold it even when the prices are plummeting. Such a trader would thus be
          called a ‘Hodler.’
        </p>
        <h2>Margin trading (trading with leverage)</h2>
        <p>Margin trading is not a trading strategy but rather a trading method. Adopted from the traditional stock
          market, it involves a trader using borrowed capital to open positions on a trading platform.
          <br />
          As anticipated, the results from trading on margin are greatly amplified to either direction of the trading
          position. If you score a win, the reward is much larger, and the reverse is also true. If the trade goes
          sideways, you also lose a lot more.
        </p>
        <p>To better understand leverage, assume you enter a trade with 5x leverage. This means that your trade’s
          position size is 5 times the capital you staked from your own pocket (i.e., margin). Usually, the exchanges
          with margin trading options offer a leverage up to 100x, which is a hazardous ‘game’ and not recommended for
          beginners.</p>

      <article>
        <p>
          It’s hard to talk about crypto trading without talking about risk management in cryptocurrency trading. It is
          another essential part of your success journey. Risk in crypto trading refers to the chance of an undesirable
          outcome happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          You may have heard that trading cryptocurrency is risky, and that is true, but so is trading all other
          financial instruments, including stocks and bonds. What differs is the level of risk.
        </p>
        <p>There are different kinds of risks, and in this section, we will discuss those related to cryptocurrency
          trading.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Market risk.</b> Perhaps the most widespread of all is the risk that a given asset’s market price or
            the overall crypto market will swing unexpectedly and negatively affect your market position.</li>
          <li><b>Liquidity risk.</b> Refers to a situation where you are unable to exit a position. Typically happens
            when you can’t find a buyer for your asset.</li>
          <li><b>Legal risk.</b> Refers to a situation where a government regulation or policy negatively impacts an
            asset or a trading platform. This could lead to liquidity problems if buyers for your asset are barred from
            purchasing it. Also, if a trading platform is banned from your jurisdiction, you could end up losing your
            funds stored with the exchange.</li>
          <li><b>Operational risk.</b> It is the risk inherent if a trader cannot perform a trading activity such as
            exiting or opening a position. It could be caused by the failure of a trading platform or malfunction of a
            trading application etc.</li>
          <li><b>Systemic risk.</b> Refers to a loss incurred due to a failure in the entire trading system. Closely
            related to the market risk, but this one is much direr given that it is caused not just by the market
            downturn but also the collapse of crucial systems within the marketplace. Think of the 2008 financial
            crisis. That was a systemic failure that led to a market meltdown.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now that you understand the kind of risks you are most likely going to encounter, you should factor them
          every time you are about to make a trading decision.</p>

      <header>Do you pay taxes when trading crypto?</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          When trading crypto, it is crucial to remember that you also have to pay fees to crypto exchanges. You can
          achieve higher profitability if you have lower platform fees. But, on top of the crypto exchange fees, it is
          essential to know that crypto tax comes on top of the trading platform fees. Just like with crypto exchange
          fees, if tax is not accounted for, it can lower your profits.
        </p>


        <p>
          Though crypto was initially unregulated, the IRS has now announced the taxation of digital assets, including
          major currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), among other top cryptocurrencies. The IRS now treats
          crypto as a regular asset, like property, stocks, bonds, or commodities such as gold. Similarly,
          cryptocurrency gains are taxed at different rates – either as income or capital gains.
        </p>

        <p>
          The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
          variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
          represent a variable.
        </p>

        <p>
          Both crypto traders and investors should know and check if they need to pay taxes on crypto. For example, in
          the US, taxpayers must report their crypto trades by law to the IRS. Our thorough and all-encompassing crypto
          tax guide will break down everything you need to know from how crypto is taxed, what exactly is taxed, when,
          and how to pay them.

      <header>Portfolio management</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          Professional traders rarely have just one asset within their portfolio. Therefore, to juggle all their
          investments and trades, they need specific tools to be efficient while trading. And that’s where portfolio
          trackers come in.
          <br /><br />
          They are software applications for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices that help track every kind of
          investment you make in the crypto market.
          <br /><br />
          By tracking your portfolio and measuring your performance, you can easily improve upon it and make better
          trades. As the saying goes, you can’t improve what you can’t measure.
          <br /><br />
          When it comes to crypto portfolio management, you want to know how much of a particular asset you hold and
          where it is stored. You also want to know how much you are gaining or losing from a particular trade or
          investment.
          <br /><br />
          Keep in mind that you could have to maintain multiple portfolios. As a trader, you might employ different
          trading strategies simultaneously, meaning you are actively trading while at the same time swing trading
          and/or position trading.
          <br /><br />
          To be a profitable trader, you will need a suite of applications from data portals and news aggregators to
          portfolio trackers. They all work in tandem to offer you real-time data you can use to make better trading and
          investment decisions.

      <header>How to pick the best cryptocurrency exchange</header>
      <article>
        There are hundreds of cryptocurrency exchanges in the market today. Some are centralized (a company runs them),
        while others are decentralized (a community runs them). Whichever option you choose comes down to your
        preferences. But here are a few factors to consider when choosing the best crypto exchange for a beginner:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Liquidity.</b> This is the number of assets supported as well as the sizes of the different order
            books. The volume of trades will give you an idea of the popularity and reliability of the exchange you are
            considering.</li>
          <li><b>Fees.</b> Knowing the fee structure of a trading platform is important because this affects the kind of
            trading strategy you choose. Let’s consider that you opt for daily trade or scalp. As we mentioned above, in
            this strategy, you will need to enter and exit multiple positions in a day to make a profit. This profit is
            dependent on your trading fees and buys/sell spreads. The lower the fees, the higher the profit margins
            (given other factors are kept constant).</li>
          <li><b>Payment options.</b> It would be best if you considered what payment options the exchange supports.
            This could be credit cards, wire transfers, other cryptocurrencies (crypto to crypto deposits), etc. Some
            platforms support a wide range of options, while others have limited options.</li>
          <li><b>Security.</b> This is especially important in cryptocurrency. Do not compromise on this factor. A
            trading platform needs to have the best security in place to secure its assets and those of its customers.
            On top of this, there should be an insurance policy for extra assurity.</li>
          <li><b>User experience.</b> The ease of navigating a trading platform is also a big consideration, especially
            so for a beginner. You want to find things easily, place orders easily, and keep track of your trades more
            easily. Typically, centralized exchanges are much more user-friendly as compared to their decentralized
            counterparts.</li>
          <li><b>Customer support.</b> Even though a trading platform seems easy to use, it is also important to
            consider how easy it is to reach the help care desk. You can check Reddit and other relevant places to read
            reviews about a platform’s customer support efficiency. This may come in handy when you have an issue.</li>

    <section class="main-section" id="14">
      <header>Recommended platforms for your first trades</header>
      <article>
        <h2>#1. Uphold (best for trading multiple assets with one account)</h2>
        <p>Uphold allows users to trade between cryptos and multiple asset classes as a single account gives you access
          to 50 U.S. stocks, over 200 cryptocurrencies, four precious metals, and 27 national currencies.
          <br /><br />
          The exchange uses proprietary security procedures, such as storing 90% of funds in cold storage and having an
          insurance policy that protects currency stored on the platform against security breaches.
          <br /><br />
          Uphold is a solid multi-asset trading platform for anybody looking to purchase precious metals, fiat
          currencies, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. In addition, unlike many of its rivals, Uphold provides carbon
          credit tokens, which are a kind of eco-currency.
        </p>
        <h2>#2. Coinbase (suitable for beginners)</h2>
        <p>Coinbase is a suitable cryptocurrency exchange for beginners who want to prioritize security and convenience.
          The platform makes buying and trading cryptocurrencies simple, while also providing high levels of security
          and transparency. In addition to its user-friendly interface, it offers trading, institutional benefits, and
          digital storage to consumers in more than 100 countries.
          <br /><br />
          Coinbase fees, on the other hand, may be more expensive than those charged by competitors, but since the
          company is publicly listed on the Nasdaq and is regulated in the United States, it is a good fit for customers
          who are hesitant to buy or trade crypto. Therefore, in exchange for simpler deposit and withdrawal options,
          you will have to pay a greater fee.
        </p>
        <h2>#3. Binance (best for spot & advanced trading)</h2>
        <p>However, those traders who want to step up to manual trading can choose Binance for low fees, a variety of
          order types and payment options. Whatsmore, Binance caters to experienced users with comprehensive charting
          options, with an abundance of advanced indicators and overlays. There are over 500 cryptocurrencies for
          trading and an enormous selection of transaction types.
          <br /><br />
          Despite the fact that Binance is user-friendly and provides three tiers of service structured according to
          trading expertise. However, it is not as straightforward to use as the Coinbase platform and it is more
          oriented to those already familiar with spot trading.
